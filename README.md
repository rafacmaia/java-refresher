A personal sandbox of exercises and mini-projects to re-familiarize myself with
core Java concepts.\
It's been a while since I really dove into Java, so this is a place to play
around and start building with it again.

## What's Inside (so far) 🥡

## To Run a Project 🚀

```aiignore
java -version       // Check you have Java installed

cd 01-madlibs/src   // Navigate to the file's directory

javac MadLibs.java  // Compile (creates executable MadLibs.class)

java MadLibs        // Run it 😎
```
