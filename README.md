A personal sandbox of exercises and mini-projects to refamiliarize myself with
core
Java concepts. It's been a while since I really dove into Java, so this is a
place to play around and start building with it again.

## What's Inside (so far) 🥡

| Folder                                     | Description                                     |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [`00-madlibs`](./00-madlibs)               | Basic little Mad Libs game                      |
| [`01-pet-store-cart`](./01-pet-store-cart) | ⚠️ Incomplete pet store shopping cart simulator |

## To Run a Project 🚀

```aiignore
java -version       // Check you have Java installed

cd 00-madlibs/src   // Navigate to the file's directory

javac MadLibs.java  // Compile (creates executable MadLibs.class)

java MadLibs        // Run it 😎
```

📌 Just the beginning to keep me accountable, more Java practice projects coming
soon!
